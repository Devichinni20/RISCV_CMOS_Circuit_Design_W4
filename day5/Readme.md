### `Static behaviour evaluation ‚Äî CMOS inverter robustness ‚Äî Power supply variation`

**Overview:**

Power supply scaling directly affects the **static behavior** of a CMOS inverter ‚Äî changing its switching threshold (Vm), noise margins, and overall robustness.

**SPICE Simulation:**

- The CMOS inverter is simulated at two different supply voltages:  
  `Vdd = 2.5V` ‚Üí scaled down to `Vdd = 1V`
- PMOS and NMOS sizes remain constant:  
  - `Wp = 0.9375 Œºm`, `Wn = 0.375 Œºm`

‚úÖ **Switching Threshold (Vm)**:  
As `Vdd` decreases, the inverter's switching threshold **Vm** tends to move toward the center of the supply range ‚Äî but noise margins shrink.

‚úÖ **Noise Margins**:  
Lower `Vdd` ‚Üí reduced noise immunity ‚Üí circuit becomes more sensitive to noise and supply variations.

‚úÖ **Performance Impact**:  
Low `Vdd` operation reduces static and dynamic power ‚Äî but limits noise robustness.  
High `Vdd` improves noise margin, but increases power dissipation.

While power scaling is essential for low-power design, it introduces trade-offs in noise margin and reliability ‚Äî requiring careful balancing in circuit design.

This plot illustrates how the **Voltage Transfer Characteristics (VTC)** of a CMOS inverter shift with **different power supply levels (Vdd scaling)** ‚Äî showing progressive reduction in noise margins as Vdd decreases.

**Advantages of using 0.5V supply:**

Using **lower Vdd (0.5V)** provides benefits like **~50% gain improvement** and **~90% reduction in energy consumption**, demonstrating the efficiency of power supply scaling in CMOS inverters.

**Disadvantage of using 0.5V supply**:

- While lowering Vdd improves gain and energy efficiency, it introduces **performance impact** ‚Äî circuits may switch slower due to reduced drive strength.

### `Static behaviour evaluation-CMOS inverter robustness-Device variation`

#### Device Variation and CMOS Inverter Robustness

**Device variation** is one of the key factors that define the robustness of a CMOS inverter. Variations can occur due to:

- **Etching Variation**
- **Oxide Thickness Variation**

### `Etching Variation`

- **Etching** is a critical step in semiconductor fabrication.
- It defines the **physical structures** in the CMOS layout ‚Äî such as **Width (W)** and **Length (L)** of transistors.

During fabrication, small deviations can occur between the **designed** and **actual** dimensions:

- **P-diffusion region** ‚Üí defines the **width of PMOS gate**  
- **N-diffusion region** ‚Üí defines the **width of NMOS gate**  
- **Poly-silicon layer thickness** ‚Üí defines the **gate length (L)**, which corresponds to the technology node (e.g., 20nm, 30nm, 45nm).

Other key layout features impacted by etching:

- **Metal layers**
- **Contacts between layers**

#### Impact on Device Performance

- The **actual W and L** of fabricated transistors often differ from ideal values.
- Since **drain current (Id)** depends on **W** and **L**, etching variations directly affect the transistor current.
- This leads to variations in the CMOS inverter‚Äôs:

  - **Switching Threshold (Vm)**
  - **Noise Margins**
  - **Overall robustness and performance**
 
This image illustrates **etching variation** in CMOS fabrication ‚Äî showing the difference between the **ideal mask (design)** and the **actual fabricated structure**.  
Variations in **W (width)** and **L (length)** occur due to process limitations, impacting **device performance** and **current drive**.

<img width="783" height="445" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8361a2f9-86b4-4fe8-80d0-eec79b1bc432" />


This image shows an **Inverter Chain** ‚Äî a sequence of multiple CMOS inverters connected in series.  
The bottom view illustrates the **physical layout** of each inverter in the chain, showing key layers:  
Poly (Gate), P-Diffusion, N-Diffusion, VDD, VSS.  
Such chains are commonly used to study **delay**, **robustness**, and **variations** across multiple stages of logic.

### `Oxide Thickness Variation`

During MOSFET fabrication, there is often a difference between the **ideal oxide thickness** of the gate and the **actual oxide thickness** achieved.

Since **I<sub>d</sub>** depends on **C<sub>ox</sub>** (oxide capacitance), any variation in oxide thickness directly impacts the drain current (I<sub>d</sub>), thereby affecting the performance of the CMOS inverter.

The image below illustrates the difference between **ideal** and **actual** oxide thickness during fabrication:

<img width="812" height="449" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/381737f1-476a-4e94-bbdf-026c8e602e3f" />

These **two minimal variations** ‚Äî *etching variation* (impacting W and L) and *oxide thickness variation* ‚Äî play a key role in defining the **robustness** of CMOS inverters.

Next, let's perform a **sweep of the PMOS and NMOS widths** as shown below:

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (205)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57825b01-5513-49b7-8585-f64131918521" />


### `Transistor Strength Definitions:`

- **Strong PMOS**:
  - Lower resistance PMOS ‚Äî provides an easier path to charge the output capacitor.
  - Achieved by using a **wider PMOS**.

- **Weak NMOS**:
  - Higher resistance NMOS ‚Äî since **resistance is inversely proportional to area**.
  - Achieved by using a **narrower NMOS**.

- **Weak PMOS**:
  - Higher resistance PMOS.
  - Achieved by using a **narrower PMOS**.

- **Strong NMOS**:
  - Lower resistance NMOS.
  - Achieved by using a **wider NMOS**.

As the **PMOS width** is larger than the **NMOS width**, the PMOS provides a stronger pull-up path ‚Äî causing the output to stay high for a longer duration when compared to the NMOS curve.
